<h2>Welcome!</h2>
I am Tung Huynh, a software engineer and a researcher. My interests includes the Mind and the Universe.
<br/>
Currently in this summer, I work under a colaboration between <a href="https://uh.edu">UH</a> 
and <a href="https://uth.edu">UTHealth</a>. At UH, I work in the <a href="https://cpl.uh.edu">Computational Physiology Lab</a> 
under advisory of <a href="">Dr. Ioannis Pavlidis</a></p>

<h2>My journey</h2>
Previously, I used to be with
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://mp3.zing.vn">ZingMe, VNG</a>, the biggest social network in Vietnam before Facebook came.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/ihpc">Institute of High-Performance Computing (IHPC, A*STAR).</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://seedcom.vn">SEEDCOM</a>, an energetic company with a positive culture.</li>
    </ul>
In 2014, my former colleagues from IHPC and I founded a trip planner application <a href="https://justgola.com">Justgola</a> (before named <i>fiuzu</i>) in Singapore. 
This project won the first prize of <a href="https://e27.co/singtel-accelerator-challenge-2015-wants-power-smarter-living-technology-20150921/">Samsung Mobile App Challenge</a> in Singapore and was seed funded. 
Although it was not as successful as expected and temporarily stopped in 2019, it was still a truly meaningful journey of my life.
